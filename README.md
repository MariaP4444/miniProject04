### DJ system
For this project, we built a basic DJ system using OSC Controller and Pure Data. First, we assigned functions to each button on the OSC Controller. The system consists of two main features:

- Drum machine patterns
- Piano
For the drum machine patterns, we assigned three sliders to control the values for the kick, snare, hi-hat, and BPM. Eight buttons were designated for eight different drum machine patterns. Meanwhile, fourteen buttons were allocated for two piano scales. These piano scales can be changed using toggles, providing a total of 8 available scales. Additionally, we included 9 filters to simulate the following instruments and sounds:

- Timpani
- Tubular bells
- Crystal
- Celesta
- Electric bass
- Voice oohs
- Atmosphere
- Square
